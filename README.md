# Steps in recreating the Nairobi LUG

* There is a hidden bezier line that puts the Nairobi LUG on path around the mug
* Gotta find a way to make that line's opacity to 100%, otherwise you don't get to edit it properly
* Better have the fonts: Open sans, Merriweather and Cabin Sketch
* Better have Inkscape running on GNU/Linux when you open the SVG
